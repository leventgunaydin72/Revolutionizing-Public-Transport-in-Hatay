# Revolutionizing-Public-Transport-in-Hatay
Has 3 Collaborators @melisapan @goncagul22 @lutfiyebabaiban
Our project aims to develop an artificial intelligence-supported mobile application that will radically change the public 
transportation system in Hatay. Considering the difficulties experienced by citizens in transportation in the housing areas reshaped 
after the earthquake, we aim to offer innovative solutions to these problems thanks to this application.
